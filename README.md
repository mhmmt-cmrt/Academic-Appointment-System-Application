# student-appointment-system
this project is prepared by myself for c++ lesson's project

The Task

You are required to code a lecturer appointment system for students. In this system,
student will have number, name, surname, department, start date, email and
(mobile)phone properties. Lecturers will have employee number, name, surname,
academic chair, email, phone properties. 

The appointment will have student, lecturer, date,
start and finish times. The relevant information about the students, lecturers and
appointments should be read from the relevant files during the program start. The new
information input to the program should be save to the files and kept in these files. The
student number and employment numbers are unique and can be used to distinguish
individuals. 

The user interface should allow the user to add, list, delete and update
students, lecturers and appointments respectively. It should be possible to search for
appointments and make sure that the appointments do not overlap for the same users.
Furthermore, each users appointments for a given interval should be printed on the
screen. In this work you are expected to take advantage of composition and inheritance
properties of OOP design.
